First (if you understand what the script does!) make sure you've
cleaned the build products from fiji:

  ./clean-ignored-files

On a 32 bit machine:

  dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -us -uc -I.git

(This may prompt you to rename the fiji directory, in which case you
should do that.)

Do the same on a 64 bit machine.  scp the output in the directory
above to pacific and follow the instructions in
simple-apt-repository-setup.
