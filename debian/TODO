Could we use the packaged commons-math?
  http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/libcommons-math-java
  http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/libcommons-math-java

jna.jar is packaged in libjna-java - should use that

Need all the fiji-*.copyright files - needs more detail than in
   LICENSES, with the source of the information and a link
   to the full license in /usr/share/common-licenses/ where possible.

Allow a per-user plugins directory as well as the system-wide one.

bio-formats includes lots of jars in the source archive - there's a
   dependency tangle to be sorted out there

fiji-plugins is still plugin soup - more packages need to be separated
   out from there over time

debian/update-debian.py has a lot of hard-coded data, which should be
   tidied up and extracted out.  (Some doesn't need to be hard-coded
   at all.)  In general, that's now very hacky - especially the
   cleaning steps and rewriting of the Fakefile.)

AutoComplete and RSyntaxTextArea can usefully be non-Fiji jars,
   i.e. just a jar in /usr/share/java/

The menu icon seems to have stopped working at some point

The upload-to-pacific.py script should use an SSH control master

Need to document and enforce the right submodules being present.  At
   the moment I think the required minimum is:

       AutoComplete
       ImageJA
       RSyntaxTextArea
       Retrotranslator
       TrakEM2
       bio-formats
       commons-math
       ij-plugins
       imglib
       live-helper
       mpicbg
       tcljava
