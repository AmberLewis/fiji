fiji (20091110) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of the package now depends on openjdk-6-jdk
  instead of sun-java6-jdk.  If you want to carry on using Fiji
  with sun-java6, you should install sun-java6-jdk and then edit
  /etc/default/fiji to set FIJI_JAVA_HOME.  Users can still
  override this by setting JAVA_HOME in their environment.
